# ECFI-178B
Backward Edge Control Flow Integrity for Real-Time Embedded Systems

## Prerequisites
A (non-exhaustive) list of software necessary to build the project

- gcc
- make
- doxygen (optional, documentation)
- graphviz (optional, documentation)
- valgrind (optional, memory usage analysis)

## Building
```bash
make
```

### Compile to assembly ###
To compile to assembly (for example the BOF4.c file):
```bash
make asm/BOF4.s
```

## Testing
To compile and test the ringbuffer library:
```bash
make runtests
```
To compile and test the CFI executable:
```bash
make -B all
LD_PRELOAD=bin/lib/libringbuffer.so bin/cfi-checker bin/injection-test
```

To compile and test the BOF4 executable:
```bash
make -B all
LD_PRELOAD=bin/lib/libringbuffer.so bin/cfi-checker bin/BOF4
```

## Debugging
To load the cfi-checker injection test in gdb, with debug symbols:
```bash
make -B debug 
LD_PRELOAD=bin/lib/libringbuffer.so gdb --args bin/cfi-checker bin/injection-test
```
To end up in the right process, you may have to `set follow-fork-mode child` at an appropriate point in gdb.

## Running
```bash
make -B all
LD_PRELOAD=bin/lib/libringbuffer.so bin/cfi-checker <path to executable>
```

## Architecture ##
Memory layout for ring buffer:

Activity diagram of the CFI-Checker.

![Please read src/cfi-checker.c if you cannot see this picture.](doc/diagrams/cfi-checker_activity.png "Activity diagram that shows how the processes interact.")

## Optimisation points:
- Use thread instead of separate process for the checker

## Known issues:
- rb_destroy is too aggressive. This will cause problems in certain cases. Needs to be fixed.
- Check correct memory usage of structs (maybe use offsetof)
- If the checker is aborted it may be necessary to manually delete the ringbuffer: ```rm /dev/shm/rb_cfi_*```
- Ring buffer is (world?) writable.
- Ringbuffer administration has critical sections. Need to verify whether violating them only causes data loss, or invalidates program invariants.

## Real-Time Features:
- Priority handling using Ringbuffer
- Lock free implementation
- Formally verifiable hard Real-Time in the injected code.
