To install the modified angrutils in the ubuntu (assuming you already made  mkvirtualenv named as angr) do the following:

1. Make sure you do not have the angr open in any terminal. 
2. Go to /home/ali/.virtualenvs/angr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/angrutils/visualize.py and copy this visualize.py and replace it with the original one.
